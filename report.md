## Introduction

The JanSunwai application was originally developed to bridge the gap between citizens and government administration, providing a digital platform for registering complaints and tracking their resolution. While the concept addresses a critical need in digital governance, the implementation suffered from significant usability challenges that hindered adoption and effective use.

This HCI project undertook a systematic analysis of the original application's shortcomings through user reviews and feedback, followed by a comprehensive redesign to address these issues. The goal was to transform the application into an intuitive, accessible, and efficient tool that serves citizens from diverse backgrounds, including those with limited technical familiarity and varying language preferences.

## Problem Statement

The original JanSunwai application, despite its important purpose, suffered from numerous usability issues that created barriers for users attempting to register and track their grievances. These issues included confusing navigation paths, poorly designed forms, system instability, inadequate error handling, and significant language localization problems. The application received consistently negative feedback regarding its interface, functionality, and overall user experience, indicating a critical need for redesign with human-centered principles.

## User Feedback Analysis

An extensive analysis of user reviews revealed several key categories of issues:

### 1. Interface Design & Navigation Issues

Users frequently reported difficulty navigating the application, particularly when selecting departments and categories:

- "*The department selection list is absolutely blank. The only way to find out what you are selecting is clicking it one by one and see the final heading. If its not your interested department then try hidden and trial method each time.*" - deepali biswas
- "*The app is like government only, updated regularly, have the ability to perform required tasks but do not work at all. Moreover if it ever opens by mistake, the department list is not translated in English so that you cannot select right department quickly.*" - Deepesh Grover

### 2. Localization & Language Issues

Many users expressed frustration with inconsistent language implementation:

- "*Even after selection on English language option of department is in Hindi. There is no option to mention issue without selection of department. It becomes difficult to search specific category.*" - keep walking keep smiling
- "*Purpose is awesome, but what is the point of giving language options, when all the departments are in Hindi, if I am choosing English language, everything should be in English.*" - A Google user

### 3. Form Design & Input Issues

The complaint registration process was hindered by problematic form design:

- "*Your proforma to register grievance do not accept mobile no. at column mentioned for mobile no. I. kindly rectify it so that mob.no.may be entered in column mentioned for mobile no. 1.*" - Mahendra Singh
- "*I am registering grievance and on grievance area detail screen, Area field is greyed out and rural is selected by default. Because rural is selected and I cannot change it, as it is read only; I am unable to register complaint.*" - Chitra Sahai

### 4. Document Upload Issues

Users struggled with attaching supporting documents to their complaints:

- "*This app is good and useful but there is no system of uploading written complaints with enclosure. There is still no proper system to attach documents.*" - Ravi Jauhari
- "*There is no option to attach more documents and the size of documents is too short (500kb only). While now days mostly gadgets create minimum documents size upto 3-5 MB.*" - A Google user

### 5. System Responsiveness & Stability

The application suffered from technical issues that disrupted the user experience:

- "*Jan sunwai application automatically auto rotate. It results to delete all entered entries. Application doesn't have all wards entered. Sometimes application hanging issues issue and automatically close.*" - Arora Arora
- "*Need some improvement: 1. App keeps auto rotating while auto rotate is turned off. 2. Requests are getting resolved only in the portal not in reality.*" - Sunny Singh

### 6. Feedback & Error Handling

Users reported inadequate feedback mechanisms:

- "*The feedback system is not working in this app or website. I could not fill the feedback of any complaint. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible in both app and website.*" - K.R K.G
- "*It is just useless app as all the complaints are closed prematurely without any investigation or resolution. And u can't give feed back to the same as your feedback will not be submitted although they have a option for feedback but it does not work.*" - chand umar

### 7. Privacy & Permissions Issues

Many users were concerned about the application's extensive permission requests:

- "*I don't understand why the need to access contact list messages and manage phone calls... if the permissions are not granted you can't use this application. I don't feel the need to share my phones contact or call permissions. There has to be a valid reason for it.*" - ILA DAVID
- "*Worst app ever. Asks for several permission like contacts, phone, location files and media, raises suspicion than I think govt is spying on installer's data. And notification to give permission is constantly displayed on screen, though app is not in use. Total Harassment.*" - MAHENDRA S

**Implementation Example**:

```
// Example of permission request pattern
func requestLocationPermission() {
    // First show explanation
    showExplanationDialog(
        title: "Location Permission",
        message: "Your location is used only to accurately record the location of your complaint. This helps authorities respond to the correct area.",
        allowLaterOption: true
    )
  
    // Then request permission only when user understands and agrees
    if userAgreed {
        locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
    }
}
```
