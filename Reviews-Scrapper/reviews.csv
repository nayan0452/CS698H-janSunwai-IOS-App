A Google user,"November 22, 2018",I appreciate the initiative by UP govt. But my 2* is for poor grievance redressal mechanism.

ANKUR TOMAR,"November 24, 2022",I'm a bit dissatisfied and disappointed as departments keep on rolling the 'ball' to one another and wasting time. One drawback is that complain itself is going to the related department and it replies that this is not related to us. If the solution is not in your hands then you should be able to transfer it to the respective department other than cancelling it and the complaint has to be filed afresh. The customer care feedback is also acting smart giving you only 10 seconds to pick the phone,4
A Google user,"October 7, 2019","Yes it is good but the first version where the choice of officers filling option available was very good .because this when you complain it will give to the the lower officers and always it same , then the probability of judgement is no fair. 2nd one is the option of mukhymantri sikayat ,arthik madad etc the raising of complain option for this is not in this app",37
